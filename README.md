🚀 CodeLab

⚠️ Currently in active development!
CodeLab is a collaborative, real-time coding platform designed for teams, students, and developers who want to write, run, and discuss code together seamlessly. Think of it as a mix of Google Meet, Replit, and ChatGPT in one unified platform.

💡 What is CodeLab?
CodeLab is a MERN-stack web app that lets you:
✅ Create and share a unique session link to invite collaborators
✅ Code together in multiple languages with a built-in online compiler
✅ Control who can write in the shared editor (one writer at a time)
✅ Chat via text, voice, and video right inside the session
✅ Use an AI assistant to get instant summaries or explanations of your code

🌟 Planned Features
Authentication: Only registered users can create or join sessions.
Meeting Links: Generate and share unique session URLs.
Code Compiler: Supports multiple languages with real-time execution.
Access Control: Only one active writer at a time; admin can assign access.
Live Chat: In-session text messaging.
Voice & Video Chat: Microphone and camera integration for face-to-face collaboration.
AI Code Assistant: One-click explanations and summaries of code using AI.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Socket.io, WebRTC
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, JWT Authentication
Compiler Service: Judge0 API or custom Docker-based code execution
AI Integration: OpenAI API for code explanation and summarization

🚧 Note: This project is still under development.
